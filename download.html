<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
<p>
The software linked to below comes with NO WARRANTY of ANY KIND. Its in 
extreme alpha mode and can easily jack your machine if you're not careful.
Consider yourself warned. Don't come crying to me aching for vengence when this 
program formats your hard drive and inadvertently murders your entire family.
</p>
<h2>Use Extreme Caution with Macaroni Code You Didn't Write</h2>
<p>
Macaroni makes extensive use Lua scripts. Because it mixes them in with typical 
source code, this means that
<b>any program code you download can harm your machine even if all you're doing
is running something innocent like "clean".</b> This is typically the case 
with Makefiles and the like
but Macaroni makes harming other peoples machines even easier.
</p>

</center>

<h3>Set Up Instructions</h3>
<p>
Macaroni uses a series of Lua scripts as well as a Messages file which sit
alongside its executable.</p>
<p> 
In Windows this just works, but in Linux its difficult to know what this
is. In that environment you just need to make sure you always invoke it using
the full path. So if you download it to ~/macaroni-0.1.0.22/, 
then you need to invoke it as $~/macaroni-0.1.0.22/macaroni 
every single time. If this is a hassle you can make a bash script to invoke it
and use that instead.</p>
<p>
Second, Macaroni sets up shop in a directory called Macaroni that lives under
your home directory (C:\Users\your_name\Macaroni in Windows, 
/home/your_name/Macaroni in Linux, etc). What's that you say, you already have
a directory living there named Macaroni and its actually your favorite 
directory on your machine? Well then, I guess <i>youuuuu</i> just won't be able
to use Macaroni, will you?
</p>
<p>
Create this directory and within it create a file name "init.lua." Put the
following stuff inside of it:
</p>
<blockquote>
properties = <br/>
{<br/>
  boost = <br/>
  {<br/>
    ["1.46.1"] =<br/>
    {<br/>
      include = [[C:/Tools/boost_1_46_1]],<br/>
      lib = [[C:/Tools/boost_1_46_1/stage/lib]],<br/>
      path = [[C:/Tools/boost_1_46_1]],      <br/>
    },<br/>
  },<br/>
  lua =<br/>
  {<br/>
    ["5.1.4"] =<br/>
    {<br/>
      include = [[C:/tools/Lua/lua-5.1.4/src]],<br/>
      source = [[C:/tools/Lua/lua-5.1.4/src]]<br/>
    },<br/>
  },<br/>
};<br/>
properties.boost.current = properties.boost["1.46.1"];<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a place to store machine specific configuration data for use in 
building projects. The idea is that most stuff in Macaroni then won't have to
use hard-coded paths.
</p>
<p>
The "lua" part is optional but "boost" is required. I thought of not making it
a requirement for using Macaroni but after awhile just gave in because being
able to assume its there somewhere made so much of the build process nicer.  If
you've never used Boost before you should look into it- its definetely more
interesting than the page you're viewing now. You can read its docs on 
getting started <a 
href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/more/getting_started/">here</a>.
