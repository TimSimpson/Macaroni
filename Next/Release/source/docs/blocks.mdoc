<h2>Blocks</h2>

<p>
C++ code is incredibly complex before you consider things such as template
metaprogramming and the preprocessor.
Figuring out a way to correctly handle any possible combinations
of C++ constructs in a way that would be universally applicable as well as
intuitive is beyond the powers of Macaroni.
</p>
<p>
That's OK though because Macaroni includes a way to insert naked C++ code
when the parser itself is not accomodating enough to do what you might need.</p>

<h4>The ~block keyword.</h4>
<blockquote>
Usage:<br/>
~block "id" { /* code */ }
</blockquote>
<p>
The keyword "~block" tells Macaroni to put a block of text as-is into a
generated file. ~block should be followed by a string containing the
short ID of the generated file. This ID only makes sense in the context of
what's being parsed. For example, if you place a "~block" into a class, then
you usually want the text to appear in the class's H or CPP file.</p>

<p><b>Caution</b>: The block ID is dependent on the Macaroni source code
generators, so in principle any "ID" is OK. However, unless you use the IDs
specified below nothing will get written to the generated source CPP and H
files.
</p>

<p>
This may sound confusing but its actually pretty simple. Here are the possible
use cases:
</p>

<h4>Classes</h4>
<p>Blocks put in classes end up in the class header of implementation file
depending on the ID. Here's some examples:
<ul>
<li><b>h-predef</b> - Appears in the header file, before the class
                      definition.</li>
<li><b>h</b> - Appears in the header file, inside the class
               definition<b>*</b>.</li>
<li><b>h-postdef</b> - Appears in the header file, after the class
                       definition.</li>
<li><b>cpp-include</b> - Appears in the implementation file, after the internal
                         include statements but before the function
                         definitions.</li>
<li><b>cpp</b> - Appears in the implementation file, after the include
                 statements, and interspersed with the function
                 definitions<b>*</b>.</li>
</ul>
<b>* Note:</b> <p> The placement of "h" and "cpp" blocks depends on the order they
               are defined in the Macaroni source file.</p>

<p>The following example shows all how all class blocks are applied.</p>

<~lua
showFile("Macaroni.Examples", "Blocks", "1.0.0.0", "src/Blocks.mcpp");
~>

<~lua
showFile("Macaroni.Examples", "Blocks", "1.0.0.0", "target/BlocksExample.h");
~>

<~lua
showFile("Macaroni.Examples", "Blocks", "1.0.0.0", "target/BlocksExample.cpp");
~>

<h4>Units</h4>
<p>The ~unit keyword explicitly defines a Macaroni source file as belonging
     to a C++ translation unit which in Macaroni receives its own header
     and implementation file. The ~block keyword can be used here to make
     arbitrary C++ code appear in the generated file, which may be
     easier than writing Macaroni code if macros or other complex constructs
     are being used. Usually, the "till EOF" syntax should be used here to tell
     Macaroni the block of code ends at the end of the file.
     </p>
<ul>
<li><b>cpp</b> - Appears in the cpp unit file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following example shows how a cpp block is used with ~unit.</p>

<~lua
showFile("Macaroni.Examples", "Hello", "1.0.0.0", "source/Main.mcpp");
~>
<~lua
showFile("Macaroni.Examples", "Hello", "1.0.0.0", "target/Main.cpp");
