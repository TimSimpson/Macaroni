The Enum Keyword
================

Macaroni supports C++ enums using the same syntax as C++, with any discrepancies being inadvertent or accidental.

Here's an example of an old style enum:


.. code-block:: c++

<~#dumpi <src/old_style.mcpp> "example" ~>

And here's an example of using the C++11 "class" enums:

.. code-block:: c++

<~#dumpi <src/cpp_11.mcpp> ~>

By default, a new unit is created for each enum, but only the header file
contains anything with the cpp file being empty.

.. note::

    Note that the order enumerations are declared in Macaroni is not the same as how they are generated. If order is important, use a ~block or do not rely on auto-incrementing default values.

Lua Scripts
-----------
The enum values are accessible from Lua using the GetValues command, like so:

.. code-block:: lua

<~#dumpi <project.lua> "example" ~>

The above script produces the following output:

.. code-block:: lua

    Here's how you print out the enum values:
    BLUE='b'
    GREEN='g'
    RED='r'
