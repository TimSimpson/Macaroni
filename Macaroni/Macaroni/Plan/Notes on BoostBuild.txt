Boost.Build can be very frustrating, but once you set up a project the
resulting code is quite small.

Here's what I have at this point:

in the root of the project, I have the following in a file named jamroot.jam:

import boost ;
boost.use-project 1.42 ;

using testing ;

#use-project /Source : Source ;
#use-project MWork/GeneratedSource : MWork/GeneratedSource ;

exe macaroni 
	:	/Source//source
		MWork/GeneratedSource//generated
	;
	
Then, in Source/build.jam:
project
	:	usage-requirements
		<include>./		
		<include>../MWork/GeneratedSource
	;

alias source
	:	[ glob-tree *.c	: .svn ]
		[ glob-tree *.cpp	: .svn ]
		/boost//filesystem
		/boost//regex
	:	<include>./		
		<include>../MWork/GeneratedSource	
	;
	
and in MWork/GeneratedSource/build.jam:
project
	:	usage-requirements
		<include>./		
		<include>../../Source
	;

alias generated
	:	[ glob-tree *.c	: .svn ]
		[ glob-tree *.cpp	: .svn ]
		/boost//filesystem
		/boost//regex
	:	<include>./		
		<include>../../Source	
	;
