To create Lua glue for a class, you need:
1. GlobalTable name.
2. MetaTable name
3. A function to create 1, and then 2, and register
4. Lua Glue C functions for all static methods (global table)
5. Lua Glue C functions for all instance methods (meta table)
6. A type which contains a Lua-compatable pointer to the class being wrapped.
7. A function to push this type onto the Lua stack.
8. A function to pop this type off the Lua stack.
9. A function to "open" the glue in lua using Lua's register mechanism (#3).

This could be a type which is initialized once and kept in memory for the
duration of the program.
It seems odd to need an instance of an object to do this, but it can't be a
template due to the need for string variables.

Lua has to call C functions which are entirely global, making this difficult.
